 *  PROGRAM PURPOSE: Creatre a program that accepts 
 * a customer's orders for hammocks. The customer
 * gets a discount based on the order total (size).
 * A sales receipt will be generated.
 */
/**
 * The purpose of the main plan:Customer will be asked 
 * for a hammock choice based on small, medium or large; 
 * the quantity or hammock size; and, the color. 
 * An itemTotal is calculated for a selection, followed 
 * by a subtotal. Based on the subtotal a discount is derived, 
 * then the subtotal is re-calculated with the discount. 
 * The sales tax is based on the discounted subtotal.A total 
 * for the sale is finalized and the sales receipt is printed.
