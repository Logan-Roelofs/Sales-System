# Sales-System
Sales system developed in Java as a final project for my Java programming class. 
This project involves me developing a Java program that can take user input and process that input to create a sales receipt. Feel free to download this project and mess around with it. This is by no means a perfect program or completely bug-free but it was a project that has taught me a lot and I wanted to share. Thanks for your time!
If wanting to execute this on your local computer run the Roelofs005PA3 file as that is where the main function is located.
